1) Given MxM grid of cells. (say M=4)
2) There is a "Start" button.  As soon as user hits the start button below things happen
3) Color randomly N number of cells (say N=5)
4) User needs to uncoloured N cells in T secs. (say T=4sec) by clicking on coloured cell.
5) If user uncoloured all cells in T secs then he wins else give him C chances (say C=3).
6) In first attempt if user failed to uncoloured 5 cells in 4 sec but rather uncoloured only 3 cells then
 keep the 2 cells untouched and randomly colours 3 cells so that user will get second attempt again with 5
 coloured cells to unclear and again 4 sec of time.  User can repeat it C times (i.e. 3 times in this case) 
else he will lose the game.


Things we are looking forward are:

1) Good UI / Intuitive.
2) Quality Code
3) Object Oriented Design
4) Framework use - AngularJS
5) Try to make it generic game without hard-code values. (Take inputs from users)
